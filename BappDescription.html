    Galaxy (MITM Decryption) automatically decrypts encrypted HTTP traffic in real-time, allowing security testing of
    applications with encrypted communications as if they were plaintext. By writing custom hooks in Java, Python
    (Jython or GraalPy), or JavaScript, users can reverse-engineer and apply encryption/decryption logic to intercept
    and modify traffic across all of Burp.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Automatic encryption and decryption of HTTP requests and responses using custom hooks</li>
    <li>Support for custom hooks in multiple languages: Java, Python (Jython and GraalPy), and JavaScript</li>
    <li>Integration with security scanners including sqlmap and xray for testing encrypted endpoints</li>
    <li>Built-in examples for common encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, SM2, SM4) and complex scenarios like dynamic
        keys</li>
    <li>Works seamlessly across different Burp tools: Proxy, Repeater, Intruder, and Scanner</li>
    <li>Additional utilities: authentication bypass payload generator, Swagger API documentation parser, and JSON/query
        string converters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Galaxy tab in Burp Suite</li>
    <li>Write a custom hook implementing the four methods: <code class="InlineCode">hookRequestToBurp</code>, <code
            class="InlineCode">hookRequestToServer</code>, <code class="InlineCode">hookResponseToBurp</code>, and <code
            class="InlineCode">hookResponseToClient</code></li>
    <li>In your hook methods, implement the encryption/decryption logic that matches the target application's scheme
    </li>
    <li>Load and start the hook to enable automatic traffic processing</li>
    <li>Use Burp as normal &rarr; encrypted traffic will automatically be decrypted for viewing and editing, then
        re-encrypted when sent</li>
    <li>Right-click decrypted requests to send them to sqlmap or xray for automated vulnerability scanning</li>
</ol>
