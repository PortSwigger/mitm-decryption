Galaxy (MITM Decryption) is a Burp Suite extension that aims to simplify and increase the efficiency of testing encrypted traffic, making it as straightforward as testing plain text traffic.\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Automated traffic decryption: After setting up the custom hook, the plugin will automatically decrypt subsequent proxy traffic.</li>\n    <li>Linked with security tools: Supports links with sqlmap and xray, helping you discover potential security vulnerabilities more efficiently. </li>\n    <li>Supports multiple Burp modules: Applicable to numerous Burp modules, including Intruder, Proxy, Repeater, and Scanner.</li>\n    <li>Additional features: Bypass Host Check, Bypass Auth of Path, Parse Swagger API Doc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n\nThe Galaxy extension is useful in the following scenarios:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>During penetration testing, you find HTTP messages from the website are encrypted.</li>\n    <li>The encryption logic is complex, involving a combination of encryption algorithms, custom algorithms, and dynamic keys.</li>\n    <li>You want to use a scanner that scans plaintext requests and retrieves plaintext responses once the scan request is sent.</li>\n    <li>You can reverse engineer the websites encryption and decryption logic (including invoking client code via hook). Basic coding skills are required.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe Galaxy extension can automatically decrypt the requests/responses after proxy, and send the decrypted requests to Repeater - this then results in plaintext responses. The extension can work with sqlmap and xray to scan plaintext requests and obtain the decrypted response.\n\n,
